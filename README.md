# CM3015_MachineLearning_WineDataset
This was an exploratory machine learning project for identifying wine. This is the submitted midterm assignment.

In this assignment I was required to explore the wine dataset provided by sklearn, to use in machine learning identification of wine. I was asked to implement from scratch common machine learning algorithms such as K-Nearest Neighbor. In addition, noise was added to the dataset in order to simulate the reality of most datasets used in machine learning.

Key technologies used was python, jupyter notebooks and KERAS machine learning library.
